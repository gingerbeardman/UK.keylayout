UK.keylayout for Mac OS X 10.2 or higher
========================================

##Background
The standard British key layout makes a UK-issue Apple keyboard work as it should do, but for some of us who have typed on non-Apple keyboards our whole lives - or for those Mac owners who are using a third-party keyboard - the Apple standard layout doesn't feel quite right. For example, Shift+2 gives you @, whereas on more standard keyboards it gives you ".

##Purpose
This file will map the " @ # ~ \ | £ ` keys to be where you would expect them to be on a UK keyboard.

##How to install

1. Unzip archive
2. Copy UK.keylayout to /Library/Keyboard Layouts/
3. Log out and then back in again
4. Go to System Preferences -> International -> Input Menu
5. Scroll down half-way to UK, tick check box
6. Scroll back to top, un-check previous setting
7. Done.

##Troubleshooting
If you can't do step 6) above, check "Show input menu in menu bar" and choose the UK layout manually using the input menu

If the setting will not stick, try checking "Use one input source in all documents"
and login again

##How to use a newer version
Copy UK.keylayout over existing version, log out, then log back in again.
